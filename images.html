The credit belongs ot the man who is actualli int he arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself ina worthy cause; who at the best in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place
	shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. &quot;
